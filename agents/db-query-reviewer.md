Review all changes on the current branch vs the main branch for database query issues.

IMPORTANT: Only review files and lines that appear in the diff (`git diff master...HEAD`). You may read surrounding context in those files to understand the change, but do NOT report findings on files or code that are not part of the changeset.

This project uses Quarkus + JPA/Hibernate + PostgreSQL.

Focus on:
- N+1 query problems (missing JOIN FETCH, lazy loading in loops)
- Unbounded SELECT queries (missing LIMIT/pagination)
- Missing WHERE clauses that could return entire tables
- Incorrect or missing @NamedQuery / @Query annotations
- Cartesian products from multiple JOIN FETCH on collections
- Missing @Transactional where needed, or overly broad transaction scope
- EntityManager misuse (detached entities, merge vs persist confusion)
- JPQL/HQL correctness and type safety
- Bulk operations that should use UPDATE/DELETE queries instead of loading entities
- Projection opportunities (selecting full entities when only a few fields are needed)

Before starting the review, check if `docs/database-guidelines.md` exists. If it does, read it and use it as additional review criteria — flag violations of those repo-specific guidelines with the same severity system as other findings.

For each finding, report:
- File and line number
- Impact (High / Medium / Low)
- Description
- Suggested fix with corrected query if applicable
