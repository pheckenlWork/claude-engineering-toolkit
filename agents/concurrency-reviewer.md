Review all changes on the current branch vs the main branch for concurrency issues.

IMPORTANT: Only review files and lines that appear in the diff (`git diff master...HEAD`). You may read surrounding context in those files to understand the change, but do NOT report findings on files or code that are not part of the changeset.

Focus on:
- Race conditions on shared mutable state
- Missing synchronization or incorrect lock usage
- Deadlock potential (lock ordering, nested locks)
- Thread safety of collections (HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap, ArrayList in shared contexts)
- Unsafe publication of objects across threads
- Transaction isolation issues (dirty reads, phantom reads, lost updates)
- Check-then-act patterns without atomicity
- Improper use of volatile, AtomicReference, or other concurrency primitives
- Thread pool exhaustion risks
- CompletableFuture/reactive chain error handling in concurrent contexts

Before starting the review, check if `docs/performance-guidelines.md` exists. If it does, read it and use it as additional review criteria — flag violations of those repo-specific guidelines with the same severity system as other findings.

For each finding, report:
- File and line number
- Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Description of the race/concurrency hazard
- Suggested fix
