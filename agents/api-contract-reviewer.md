Review all changes on the current branch vs the main branch for API contract issues.

IMPORTANT: Only review files and lines that appear in the diff (`git diff master...HEAD`). You may read surrounding context in those files to understand the change, but do NOT report findings on files or code that are not part of the changeset.

Focus on:
- Breaking changes (removed fields, renamed endpoints, changed types)
- Backward compatibility of request/response schemas
- REST conventions (proper HTTP methods, status codes, resource naming)
- Missing input validation at API boundaries
- Response consistency across similar endpoints
- Missing or incorrect OpenAPI/Swagger annotations
- Pagination support for list endpoints
- Proper use of API versioning
- HATEOAS or linking conventions if applicable
- Content-Type handling and Accept header support

Before starting the review, check if `docs/api-contracts-guidelines.md` exists. If it does, read it and use it as additional review criteria — flag violations of those repo-specific guidelines with the same severity system as other findings.

For each finding, report:
- File and line number
- Breaking (Yes / No)
- Description
- Suggested fix or migration strategy
