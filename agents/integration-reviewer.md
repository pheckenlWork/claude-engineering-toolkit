Review all changes on the current branch vs the main branch for integration and notification delivery issues.

IMPORTANT: Only review files and lines that appear in the diff (`git diff master...HEAD`). You may read surrounding context in those files to understand the change, but do NOT report findings on files or code that are not part of the changeset.

This is a notifications backend that delivers webhooks and notifications to external systems.

Focus on:
- Webhook delivery guarantees (at-least-once, idempotency keys)
- Retry semantics (exponential backoff, max retries, dead letter handling)
- Connector contract compliance (do new connectors follow the established interface?)
- Timeout handling for outbound HTTP calls
- Circuit breaker patterns for failing endpoints
- Payload serialization correctness and versioning
- Authentication/credential handling for outbound calls
- Event ordering guarantees where required
- Graceful degradation when downstream systems are unavailable
- Message deduplication and idempotency

Before starting the review, check if `docs/integration-guidelines.md` exists. If it does, read it and use it as additional review criteria — flag violations of those repo-specific guidelines with the same severity system as other findings.

For each finding, report:
- File and line number
- Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Description
- Suggested fix
